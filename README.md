StoreCard (PrePaid) StoredValue iPad Application Demo
=========
This is a resource for developers and interested payment integrators to see how simple it is to get your iOS POS to integrate with Mercury StoreCard.

**iOS Simulator Note:** QR Code will not scan without building on an actual iPad device. If iOS simulating please make sure you use iPad2

##Step 1: Build Request with Key Value Pairs
  
Create a NSMutableDictionary and add all the Key Value Pairs.
  
```Objective-C
    NSMutableDictionary *dictionary = [NSMutableDictionary new];
    [dictionary setObject:num forKey:@"InvoiceNo"]; //randoNum to avoid AP*
    [dictionary setObject:num forKey:@"RefNo"]; //randoNum to avoid AP*
    [dictionary setObject:@"StoreCard iOS Demo POS" forKey:@"Memo"];
    [dictionary setObject:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%.2f", _total] forKey:@"Purchase"];
    [dictionary setObject:acct forKey:@"AcctNo"];
    [dictionary setObject:@"6453 Bistro iOS App" forKey:@"OperatorID"];
    [dictionary setObject:@"Bistro 6435 iOS Demo POS - StoreCard" forKey:@"Memo"];
    
    [self processTransactionWithDictionary:dictionary andResource:@"/PrePaid/Sale"];
```

##Step 1b: Add your choice of an image scanning SDK or use AVFoundation
  
```Objective-C
    

```


##Step 2: Process the Transaction

Process the transaction with an NSMutableURLRequest.

```Objective-C
    // Create a JSON POST
    NSMutableURLRequest *request = [NSMutableURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:self.url]];
    [request setTimeoutInterval:30];
    [request setHTTPMethod:@"POST"];
    [request addValue:@"application/json" forHTTPHeaderField:@"Content-Type"];
    [request addValue:@"application/json" forHTTPHeaderField:@"Accept"];
  
    // Add Authorization header
    NSString *credentials = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@:%@", self.merchantID, self.merchantPassword];
    NSString *base64Credentials = [self base64String:credentials];
    [request addValue:[@"Basic " stringByAppendingString:base64Credentials] forHTTPHeaderField:@"Authorization"];
    
    // Serialize NSDictionary to JSON data
    NSData *jsonData = [NSJSONSerialization dataWithJSONObject:dictionary options:NSJSONWritingPrettyPrinted error:nil];
    
    // Add JSON data to request body
    [request setValue:[NSString stringWithFormat:@"%lu", (unsigned long)[jsonData length]] forHTTPHeaderField:@"Content-Length"];
    [request setHTTPBody: jsonData];
    
    // Process request async
    [NSURLConnection connectionWithRequest:request delegate:self];
```
##Step 3: Parse the Response

Parse the Response using in the connection didReceiveData delegate.

Approved transactions will have a CmdStatus equal to "Approved".

```Objective-C
- (void) connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReceiveData:(NSData *)data {
    
    // Deserialize response from REST service
    NSDictionary *result = [NSJSONSerialization JSONObjectWithData:data options:kNilOptions error:nil];

    if ([result objectForKey:@"CmdStatus"]
      && [[result objectForKey:@"CmdStatus"] isEqualToString:@"Approved"]) {
      
      // Approved logic here
      
    } else {
      
      // Declined logic here
      
    }
}
```
